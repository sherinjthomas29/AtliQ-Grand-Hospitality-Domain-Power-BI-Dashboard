## üìà**Key Features and Elaborated Insights**

The dashboard is built around a series of key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations that tell a clear story about the hotel chain's health and performance.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

**Total Revenue**: ‚Çπ6.62 Billion, showing overall financial health.

**Occupancy Rate**: 68.6%, indicating how many rooms are filled.

**Realization**: 63.8%, showing the percentage of potential revenue collected.

**Key Insights**

**Market Performance**: Mumbai is the most profitable market with the highest ADR and RevPAR, while Delhi may need focused improvements.

**Booking Platforms**: MakeMyTrip is the primary source of bookings, followed by Direct bookings and other Online Travel Agencies (OTAs).

## üí°**Suggestions and Improvement Areas**
Based on the dashboard analysis, here are some key areas AtliQ Hotels could focus on for improvement:

**Market-Specific Strategy**: The dashboard shows a significant disparity in ADR and RevPAR between markets like Mumbai and others. The company should analyze the factors contributing to Mumbai's success (e.g., pricing, amenities, target audience) and see if these strategies can be replicated in other, lower-performing markets to boost revenue.

**Weekend Peak Management**: The strong performance on weekends presents both an opportunity and a challenge. AtliQ Hotels could consider dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue during these peak periods. Conversely, they should explore marketing campaigns or special offers to increase occupancy on weekdays, which appear to have lower demand.

**Booking Channel Optimization**: While MakeMyTrip is the top booking channel, the company should investigate the cost per acquisition for each platform. If the commission rates for MakeMyTrip are high, they could explore ways to increase direct bookings through their own website or app by offering exclusive deals or loyalty points.

**Targeted Guest Marketing**: The dominance of the "Business" guest segment suggests a strong B2B focus. AtliQ Hotels could further analyze this segment to identify key corporate clients or industries and create tailored packages. They could also launch specific campaigns to attract more Leisure and Transit guests to diversify their customer base.

**Room Class Profitability**: The dashboard provides occupancy rates by room class. A deeper analysis, perhaps by integrating room-specific revenue data, could help determine the profitability of each room type. If a certain room class has high occupancy but low RevPAR, it might be an area for price adjustments or a re-evaluation of its market position.
